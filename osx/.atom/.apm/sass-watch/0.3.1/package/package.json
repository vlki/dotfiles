Hit enter and thats it, Sass Watch will watch the file for changes and compile the css to the supplied output.\n\n## Viewing Watchers\n\n`Sass Watch: List` brings up a list of watchers. Select a watcher from the list and you will be given some details about the watcher, from here you can stop the watcher.\n\n## Behind the Scenes\n\nSass Watch binds to the save event in [Atom] which saves running any kind of filesystem watcher and means that your file is only re-compiled if _you_ save it in Atom instead of anything on your system touching the file.\n\n[SASS]: http://sass-lang.com/\n[Atom]: http://atom.io\n","readmeFilename":"README.markdown","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/arcath/sass-watch/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/arcath/sass-watch#readme","_id":"sass-watch@0.3.1","_shasum":"be70b3ed7b2b292085ed2635bdf1a2c872db15ca","_resolved":"file:../d-115113-91851-1mgvs1u/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115113-91851-1mgvs1u/package.tgz"}
